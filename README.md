Python 3 script to create a reverse shell using the socket library:
Be sure to replace 'your_ip' with your server's IP and your_port with the port you want to use for the connection. 
This script allows a client (the machine that will be controlled) to connect to the server and execute commands that are sent by the server. 
Output from the commands is sent back to the server.

Remember that creating and using a reverse shell on systems without authorization is a violation of privacy and security. 
Make sure you use this knowledge ethically and legally, always with proper permission.


Thanks for choosing this script.
